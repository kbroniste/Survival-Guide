  <h1>Step One: Be Honest </h1>
  <p>This is a very crucial step. Tell the boy bluntly that you are not
    interested. Their simple mind will interpret this as you find them irresistable
    and that you want them to continue to pursue.
    <b>This is worse than Opposite Day.</b>
    There is not end to this, when too annoying just block them. <b> Do not
    attempt to reason with them. <i>I repeat do not attempt to reason, their puny
  little brains cannot handle this.</i> </b> </p>
  <p>The silly creatures believe that they are God's gift to women. This is true,
    however I am still looking for the damn receipt to return to sender! Their 10
    inches is more like 10 cm. <i> Do not become penis whipped!</i><b>
      NO SEX IS THAT GOOD!</b></p> When in doubt follow the wise words of Christina
      Yang:</p>
