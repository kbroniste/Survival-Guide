<h3 align="center">By Lady Panda</h3>
<hr/>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>These steps are not perfect in anyways. However, they have been tried and
  proven effective throughout the years. It is very important to follow these
  steps <b><i>very carefully and very thoroughly.</i></b> If followed correctly, these steps
will save you allot of time and heartache.</p>
<p> If a man is not willing to court you (yes I said court! Make his lazy ass
  pursue you!), then he is not worth your time. Do not lower your standards to
  meet his self esteem. Boys now-a-days want you to chase them, they will have
  you making excuses for their bad behavior for no reason. They fuck up and you
  try to justify it. <b>FUCK THAT!</b> It is time for men to stop playing
  childish games and to step up! Do not fall into their trap of sweet words.
  <b>They are master manipulators!</b> They will tell you what you want to hear.
  They will make you feel good at first, then they get lazy.
   <b> Do not allow them to lower your standards!</b></p>
