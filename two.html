  <h1>Step Two: Respect Yourself</h1>
  <p><pre>Nothing drives a boy crazy more than you knowing your worth. They will not
  know how to react when they realize that they cannot easily control you or
  destroy you. They will find ways to make you the bad guy. A few examples of
  their toxic sayings/words are:
              1.Heartless Bitch
              2.Stubborn
              3.He will spread lies about you, because he knows he cannot have you
              4.Misleading (even though you have told him from day one you are not
              interested. But hey why listen to the words coming out of our
              mouths...),etc.</pre></p>
